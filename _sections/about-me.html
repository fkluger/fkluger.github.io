Hey there! I am a third year PhD student supervised by <a href="https://www.tnt.uni-hannover.de/staff/rosenhahn/">Bodo Rosenhahn</a>
at the <a href="https://www.tnt.uni-hannover.de/en/">Institut f√ºr Informationsverarbeitung</a>.
My main research focus lies on Machine Learning and its applications in Computer Vision,
specifically 3D Scene Understanding and Geometric Feature Extraction.
<br/>
Previously, I studied Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (BSc and MSc) at
<a href="https://www.uni-hannover.de/">Leibniz University Hannover, Germany</a>,
spent a semester abroad at <a href="https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp">Yonsei University</a> in Seoul,
and visited <a href="https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/technology/">Sony R&D</a> in Tokyo for an internship.
