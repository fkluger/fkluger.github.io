HOPE-F is a synthetic dataset for multiple fundamental matrix fitting containing 4000 image pairs. 
We use a subset of 22 textured 3D meshes from the <a href="https://github.com/swtyree/hope-dataset">HOPE dataset</a> which depict household objects.
Between one and four of these meshes are selected and placed on a 3D plane at randomised positions in order to render an image pair.
Known camera intrinsics and object poses yield the ground truth fundamental matrices for each object.
HOPE-F also provides pre-computred SIFT keypoint features with ground truth labels.
