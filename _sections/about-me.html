Hey there! I am a Computer Vision and Machine Learning PhD student supervised by <a href="https://www.tnt.uni-hannover.de/staff/rosenhahn/">Bodo Rosenhahn</a>
at the <a href="https://www.tnt.uni-hannover.de/staff/kluger/">Institut f√ºr Informationsverarbeitung</a>.
My main research focus lies on the detection of multiple geometric image features by combining well established robust estimators such as RANSAC with deep learning.
Since I have submitted my PhD thesis, I am now looking for new challenges.
<br/>
During my time as a PhD student, I have published <a href="#publications">multiple papers</a> (CVPR, T-PAMI, AAAI, ICRA, GCPR) presenting novel Computer Vision algorithms as well as <a href="#datasets">new datasets</a>.
I have also served as a reviewer for conferences and journals including CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, T-PAMI and GCPR.
<br/>
In 2022, I spent four months as a Research Scientist Intern at Meta Reality Labs London, UK.
<br/>
Previously, I studied Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (BSc and MSc) at
<a href="https://www.uni-hannover.de/">Leibniz University Hannover, Germany</a>,
spent a semester abroad at <a href="https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp">Yonsei University</a> in Seoul,
and visited <a href="https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/technology/">Sony R&D</a> in Tokyo for an internship.
