SMH is a synthetic dataset for multiple homography fitting based on a 3D model of a city.
A total of 48002 image pairs are rendered along trajectories within the 3D model.
We provide ground truth homographies for the visible planes in each image pair, as well as pre-computed SIFT features with ground truth labels.
