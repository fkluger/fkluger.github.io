HOPE-F is a synthetic dataset for multiple fundamental matrix fitting containing 4000 image pairs. 
We use a subset of 22 textured 3D meshes from the HOPE dataset to render image pairs showing between one and four objects.
HOPE-F provides ground truth fundamental matrices for each object and pre-computed SIFT keypoint features with ground truth labels.
