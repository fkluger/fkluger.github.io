SMH is a synthetic dataset for multiple homography fitting based on a <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/city-1f50f0d6ec5a493d8e91d7db1106b324">3D model of a city</a>.
A total of 48002 image pairs are rendered along trajectories within the 3D model.
We provide ground truth homographies for the visible planes in each image pair, as well as pre-computed SIFT features with ground truth labels.
